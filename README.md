# Angular-twitter

The simple application that provides OAuth login with twitter, 
subscribe and unsubscribe users in the context of an application, not in twitter. 

That means, that you can use `angular-twitter` application for following and read tweets instead of using twitter at all. 

## TODO

- Add the feature to realtime tweets from subscription.
- Add the timeline from all subscriptions.
- Create infrastructure for AWS as code. (Terraform)
- Add a github pipeline to repository.
- Update GORMv1 to GORMv2.
